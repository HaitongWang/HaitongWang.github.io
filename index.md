title: Test

Hello, my name is **Haitong Wang**.  
I am a student of GIS at school of Geography of University of Leeds.  
This is my first time to use the Github.  
  
Although I have been learning Python for a whole semester, I still can not get the final agent-based model.   
  
In this **Repository**, I only have **"ABM.py","agentframework.py"**.
  
My python code stays in creating an **Agent**(agentframework.py) to convert the code into an object oriented version.  
  
What can I get is like the picture:  
![screenshot of Console](http://github.com/HaitongWang/HaitongWang.github.io/raw/master/a.png)   
  
just the list of Agent (even not integer), but a distance between agents0 and agents1.  
  
I tried to complete the next few steps, but I can not link the afentframework with my coda, especially after I tried to make a **environment**. The TypeError always told me that: " __init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given" or "__init__() missing 3 required positional arguments:'y','environment', and 'store'."  

    
For GUI, I can just get an empty tkinter with menu bar.
  
Finally, I know I will get no mark on this assessment, but I will try to fix all these problems and get the agent-based model during the holiday.
