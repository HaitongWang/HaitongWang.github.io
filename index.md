Hello, my name is **Haitong Wang**.  
I am a student of GIS at school of Geography of University of Leeds.  
This is my first time to use the Github.  
  
Although I have been learning Python for a whole semester, I still can not get the final agent-based model.  
  
My python code stays in creating an **Agent**(agentframework.py) to convert the code into an object oriented version.  
What can I get is like the picture:
